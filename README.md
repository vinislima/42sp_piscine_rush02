# RUSH 02

Rush 02 presented a significant challenge, both technically and in terms of teamwork. The project required the creation of a program capable of converting numeric inputs into their textual representations, integrating foundational concepts such as string parsing, error handling, and dynamic memory management. Moreover, it introduced more complex requirements, such as handling custom dictionaries and ensuring compliance with strict formatting rules.

From a learning perspective, the project was an invaluable experience. It reinforced the importance of handling structured inputs effectively, adhering to precise requirements, and managing allocated memory responsibly. The need to work within the constraints of the C programming language also underscored the value of efficient resource management and robust error reporting.

However, despite our best efforts, it became evident at one point that we would not be able to deliver a functional program that met the minimum requirements. This realisation led us to set the project aside, acknowledging the gap in our ability to finalise the solution within the constraints of time and complexity. Nevertheless, we did manage to submit a project that compiled and adhered to 42’s strict coding norms, demonstrating our progress in applying what we had learned.

This experience highlighted the challenges of collaborative programming, including balancing the workload across team members and ensuring a collective understanding of the solution. While the outcome was not as successful as we had hoped, the concepts we engaged with—such as parsing, memory handling, and dictionary-based logic—will serve as a strong foundation for tackling future, more advanced challenges.
